abstract: Most advanced economies are witnessing an aging of their societies brought about by low fertility rates and
  increasing longevity, with substantial effects on rates of return and asset prices. This project focuses on the
  relationship between demographic change and house prices. Utilizing a quantitative lifecycle model calibrated
  to German microdata, I document demographic effects on house prices and their interaction with rates of return
  along a transition spanning past, present and future.
