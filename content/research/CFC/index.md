abstract: The European fiscal governance framework remains incomplete, leading to challenges
  in coordinating policy responses when facing economic shocks, and hampering
  the transmission of the single monetary policy. Moreover, high public debt burdens,
  coupled with pro-cyclical and chronically low public investment in the face of high
  investment needs hamper resilience across Member States. Several policy-makers,
  institutions and academics hence share the view that the establishment of a central
  fiscal capacity (CFC) would be an important step forward. Against this backdrop, we
  provide a framework to assess a proposal for a CFC in the euro area, aimed at stabi-
  lizing the business cycle, promoting sovereign debt sustainability as well as reducing
  the procyclicality of public investment. We develop a two-region DSGE model with
  a permanent CFC that allocates resources based on the relative output gap of the
  two regions while earmarking a fraction for public investment and imposing fiscal
  adjustment requirements for the high-debt region. We find that the introduction
  of the CFC can lead to enhanced business cycle stabilisation for both regions and
  significantly reduce the welfare cost of business cycle fluctuations. In response to an
  asymmetric shock, the CFC reduces procyclicality in public investment and tames
  the public debt burden. The analysis also explores modelling extensions to enable
  European bond issuance and implement an active supranational investment strategy
  to address investment needs by providing European Public Goods (EPGs).
