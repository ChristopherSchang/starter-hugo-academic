title: Computations and Quantitative Models in Macroeconomics
---
This is an EUI graduate level course in computational economics taught by Prof. Alexander Monge-Naranjo. The course covers a number of solution methods to solve a broad class of heterogenous agent models: 1) efficient computation of policy functions with EGM. (2) computation of transition dynamics and impulse responses with extended paths and shooting algorithms (3) solution to models with aggregate fluctuation locally using the method of sequence-space jacobians and globally Ã  la Krusell-Smith. Computation of discrete choice models with and without extreme-value shocks.
