  Aging populations, driven by low fertility rates and increasing longevity, are a defining trend in
  most advanced economies. This demographic shift has far-reaching implications for asset prices
  and rates of return. This research investigates the relationship between demographic change and
  house prices. Using a quantitative life-cycle model calibrated to German microdata, I document
  the following: In line with past trends (1) demographic factors have contributed significantly
  to the long-term rise in housing prices of which much can be attributed to indirect general
  equilibrium effects of falling real rates. (2) Based on projected demographic trends, the model
  suggests that over the remainder of the 21st century declining populations and rising old-age
  dependency ratios place downward pressure on real house prices while (3) the composition of
  wealth shifts from capital to housing wealth mitigating the drop in real rates.
